# AirBnDatabase

Most of us will remember the year 2020 as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which universally impacted the lifestyles of Americans; however, stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions were not imposed consistently across States.  Moreover, the US travel industry has increasingly shifted from hotel-centric lodging to a “sharing economy” model where private property owners can offer lodgings directly to consumers through an application such as AirBnB.  We were curious about the affects of the Covid-19 pandemic on travel trends in general and especially in how the ability of private citizens to host guests under inconsistent travel rules might have changed during 2020.  This exploratory project seeks to visualize travel in the US during 2020 by examining data on AirBnB stays.
